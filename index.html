<h1>Adam DeVon Miller's Notes</h1>

<h3>“Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand”</h3>

<p>The <b>World Wide Web</b> is a collection of <em>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</em> documents.
</p>

<!-- I tested out <i>word</i> to see if it would italicize 'word' and it did. Although <i>word</i> is easier to remember, 
I will continue to use <em>word</em> since that's what we were taught.-->

<p>Major pieces = people (their computer & browser) + the Internet + servers.
</p>

<p>HTML is made up of:
<br>  
- <em>Text content</em>: what you see
<br> 
- <em>Markup</em>: what it looks like
<br>
- <em>References to other documents</em>: e.g. images & videos
<br>
- <em>Links to other pages</em>
</p>

<p>To make a word <b>bold</b>, you have to use the less than sign 'b' greater than sign, then the word, then the less than sign foward slash 'b' greater than sign. 
Looks like I remembered how to do it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j9QeUoPOi4">Very nice, high five</a>! It's important to remember to use the forward slash
or the "stupid computer" will bold everything until you close the tag.
</p>

<b>Image</b>
<p>To add an <em>image</em>,  begin by adding the source and end it with alternate text. Let's try it below:
<br>
<br>
<img src="http://learnhtmlwithsong.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/I-have-no-idea-what-Im-doing-meme10.jpg" alt="no idea">
</p>
<br>
<b>Definitions</b>
<p><em>Tag</em>
<br>
An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags (called "void" tags) do not require a closing tag (like the break tag).
<br>
<br>
<em>Element</em>
<br>
An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
<br>
<br>
<em>Attribute</em>
<br>
This is a property of an HTML element
